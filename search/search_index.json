Each commit has a unique ID and stores information about the changes made, author, and timestamp.</li> <li>Fork: A personal copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.</li> <li>Git: A distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project and maintain a complete history of changes.</li> <li>GitHub: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. It provides features such as code hosting, issue tracking, and pull requests.</li> <li>Issue: A report on a bug, feature request, or task in a GitHub repository.</li> <li>Merge: The process of combining changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature or bug fix branch back into the main branch.</li> <li>Pull Request: A request to merge changes from one branch into another on GitHub. Pull requests allow for code review and discussion before the changes are merged.</li> <li>Remote: A version of your repository that is hosted on a server, typically on a platform like GitHub. A remote repository can be cloned and synchronized with your local repository.</li> <li>Repository (repo): A container for a project's files, including its complete history of changes. It can be hosted locally on your computer or remotely on a server.</li> <li>Staging: The process of marking changes in your working directory to be included in the next commit.</li> <li>Upstream: The main or original repository from which you forked or cloned your repository.
