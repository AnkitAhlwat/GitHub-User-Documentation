Welcome to the Github User Documentation guide. This guide is intended for new programmers that require a quick start guide on how to begin using Github.

## Pre-requisites 

While this is a beginners guide, there are still several pre-requisites in order to follow along:

- A Github account: you can sign up free [**with this link**](https://github.com/join).

- Knowledge of the command prompt/ terminal. If not, we recommend reading [**this tutorial**](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) and then returning here.
