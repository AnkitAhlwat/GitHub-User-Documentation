# Customizing your Github

It is common to link your Github on your resume and for employers to look at it. Because of this it is important to have a well organized Github profile. This section will cover some important features and settings to enhance your profile and customize your Github experience.

## Set your profile picture

This is one of your simplest, but most effective ways to have a professional looking Github. Do not use a profile picture of your favourite Anime character or worse, a default profile picture. Upload a head shot of yourself and make sure it is high resolution.

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Click on your profile icon in the top right corner of the page:
