# Glossary

This glossary contains terms that are commonly used when referring to git or Github. 

This is by no means an exhaustive list of terminology however, it covers the basics.

- **Branch**: A parallel version of a repository that allows developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
- **Clone**: To create a local copy of a remote repository on your computer.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in a repository. Each commit has a unique ID and stores information about the changes made, author, and timestamp.
- **Fork**: A personal copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. Git allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project and maintain a complete history of changes.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration using Git. It provides features such as code hosting, issue tracking, and pull requests.
- **Issue**: A report on a bug, feature request, or task in a GitHub repository.
- **Merge**: The process of combining changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature or bug fix branch back into the main branch.
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge changes from one branch into another on GitHub. Pull requests allow for code review and discussion before the changes are merged.
- **Remote**: A version of your repository that is hosted on a server, typically on a platform like GitHub. A remote repository can be cloned and synchronized with your local repository.
- **Repository (repo)**: A container for a project's files, including its complete history of changes. It can be hosted locally on your computer or remotely on a server.
- **SSH (Secure Shell)**: A cryptographic network protocol used to securely access network services over an unsecured network. In the context of Git, SSH is used to authenticate your connection to a remote repository when pushing or pulling changes.
- **Staging**: The process of marking changes in your working directory to be included in the next commit.
- **Upstream**: The main or original repository from which you forked or cloned your repository. It is considered the primary source of updates and changes.
