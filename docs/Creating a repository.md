# Creating a Repository

Creating a GitHub repository is one of the first things you need to do after creating a GitHub account.
This section is designed to help beginners create and configure a repository.

## Before You Begin

Please login to your Github profile. If you do not have a Github account refer to the home page.

## Navigating the landing page

Once you log in to GitHub, you will be directed to the landing page. The page may appear different for each individual user but the layout will remain the same.

3. (Optional) Enter a brief description of the repository:

    ![Alt text](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/pwPHwUq4dkyN.png?o=11 )

4. Select the visibility:

    * Click "Public" if you would like the repository to be viewable by everyone.

    * Click "Private" if you would like the repository to be viewable by only you and the collaborators you select.

    !!! note
        You can always change the visibility of the repository in the future so don't worry if you're unsure of which option to select.

5. (Optional) Add a "README" file:

    This file is used to provide a detailed overview of your repository.

    For more information on what a "README" file is, click [**here**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes).

    !!! tip "Tip"

        While this step is optional, we highly recommend adding a read.me to every repository as it is considered best practice and serves as a guide for other users.

6. (Optional) Add a ".gitignore." file:

    A git ignore file is a text file that is used to specify files that you do not wish to push to your Github repository. Usually the .gitignore contains sensitive information, for example you may put a private API key that you do not want others to have access to.

    For more information on what a .gitignore file is click [**here**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files).

7. Scroll down to "Choose a license":

    A license is used to help provide guidelines to other users who wish to use your repositories in the future.
